## Inspiration

_“Gender equality is the unfinished business of 21st century”_ , Supporting and Empowering women is an indispensable tool for advancing development of the world and reducing global poverty, but developing countries such as India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Afghanistan, etc. are still struggling with problems such as gender inequality, lack of awareness amongst women, women safety and lack of aspiration amongst women so, we need an innovative solution which can address these problem and hence was born **Helping Hand** - an smartphone application which can support women empowerment by helping women to keep safe, make them aware about their fundamental rights and inspiring them through example stories.


## What it does

**Helping Hand has these features :**

_**1. MyStory :**_ It is basically an platform where you can build community by sharing your inspiring stories and help other women who don't have aspiration in life to get inspired.

_**2. Awareness :**_ It is an informatic page where women can learn about there fundamental rights and use them in situations of need.

_**2. Here I am :**_ Here I am is an SOS alert app that sends alert SMS holding your location (Address and Google Maps) to your loved ones in case you are in trouble basically you just have to tap volume down button five times.


## How we built it

The project was entirely build using flutter and firebase and UI/UX was designed using Adobe XD, though connecting flutter and firebase was easy but designing part is bit of hard as we want it simple and elegant so that every one loves it.

## Challenges we ran into

The time frame given to develop the solution was just 24 hours which was actually a challenge and that's why we have to deep dive into flutter and firebase documentation to make things work.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Making this work! Woohoo! we have been working on the research side of this project for weeks but never really had the idea of how we'll make it production ready, setting and getting things running up is I think is the biggest accomplishment!

## What we learned

A lot of research was done about women support and women rights so, yes I learned allot about women empowerment and allot of new concepts about Mobile Application development.

## What's next for Helping Hand

I want Helping Hand to be an integrated community of women who are willing to help each other, kind of a social media especially for women with more in built features for safety and connectivity.
